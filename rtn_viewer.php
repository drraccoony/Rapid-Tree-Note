-----NOTE TO MAINTAINERS-----
This script simply checks if the included
`.link` attribute of a .rtn file is displayable.
If it is, a redirect there occurs. If not, display raw file contents.

It is in no way required for the RTN to function,
and just works with Apache2 RewriteEngine:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule .*\.rtn$ /rtn_viewer.php [NC,L]
