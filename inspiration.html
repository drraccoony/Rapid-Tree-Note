Inspiration
├── ​<a href="https://tree.nathanfriend.io">https://tree.nathanfriend.io</a>
│   ​├── ​This website is based on the work of Nathan Friend on their website.
│   ​├── ​Although it is functionally identical in many ways, all code is original (no code was borrowed).
│   ​└── ​Their original codebase can be found here <a href="https://gitlab.com/nfriend/tree-online">https://gitlab.com/nfriend/tree-online</a>.
├── ​Purpose
│   ​├── ​I had three main goals for changes I wanted to see done to the original project.
│   ​├── ​Faster Generation Times
│   ​│   ​├── ​In the original program by Nathan Friend, longer documents could take multiple seconds to handle drawing the tree after every single key press.
│   ​│   ​├── ​This would make it painfully slow to work on longer documents.
│   ​│   ​├── ​In my implementation, a document that would have taken Nathan's website 5000ms to handle can be calculated in around 1ms (5000x faster!)
│   ​│   ​└── ​I suspect this is made possible because of a smaller BigO notation resulting in exponentially faster computation with length.
│   ​├── ​Backward Compatibility and Ability to Resume exported documents
│   ​│   ​├── ​In the original program, if you copied the result out to a text document, it was very difficult to edit later because pasting it back in would break the tree.
│   ​│   ​└── ​In my version, pasting any exported document back into the entry field will parse it correctly such that editing can be resumed.
│   ​├── ​A single-panel implementation instead of a dual-panel view
│   ​├── ​The original implementation's dual-panel view was less than desirable.
│   ​└── ​I wanted a way to edit-in-place the document directly with a larger view (you can fit more text in a text box that is 100% versus 50% wide).
